# Placement receipts

One entry per full-path placement decision (new owner row, extract, or
bless-and-raise), newest first. Light-path placements go in the commit message only.
The receipt records the decision; `docs/module-ownership.md` and `scripts/arch.ts`
carry its result.

## 2026-10-03 — Recipes, a fifth tab (placement-advisor)

- **Ask:** MojoSOGO decided a new 🍳 Recipes tab: paste a YouTube link and the Worker reads the
  recipe from the video's own text (YouTube Data API v3 snippet + an unofficial captions attempt +
  Claude, never inventing one from the title), or type one by hand; a ▶ link and the hotlinked
  thumbnail; Add ingredients to Shopping; household-shared.
- **Verdict:** eight NEW owners, each one concern — `src/shared/recipes.ts` (the rules; pure,
  imports lists + vocab only, `INGREDIENT_MAX` derived from the lists' `TEXT_MAX`),
  `src/worker/youtube.ts` (Data API), `src/worker/youtube-captions.ts` (the unofficial attempt,
  never throws, deletable alone), `src/worker/recipe-reader.ts` (prompt + schema via `claude.ts`),
  `src/worker/routes/recipes.ts` (CRUD + the §7E.2 pipeline), and the PWA's `Recipes.tsx`,
  `RecipeView.tsx`, `RecipeForm.tsx`. Small edits only to `vocab.ts` (`RECIPE_SOURCE`,
  `CAPTIONS_FAILURE`), `env.ts`, `vitest.config.ts`, `index.ts`, `App.tsx` (one NAV entry, one render
  line) and `App.module.css` (the tab grid derives its columns from the tabs).
- **Why not extend Things to do or lists:** a recipe is neither an idea with a window nor a list
  item; it has its own source pipeline and its own wire shape. Add to Shopping reuses the existing
  `POST /lists/{SHOPPING_LIST_ID}/items`, once per ingredient from the PWA — no bulk route, and R11
  asserts every ingredient the rules can produce is accepted by that route.
- **Why the two seams first:** `claude.ts` and `Grow.tsx` were opened (receipt below) so Recipes
  imports them instead of reaching into the photo reader or the thing form. `claude.ts`,
  `photo-reader.ts`, `thing-photos.ts`, `routes/lists.ts`, `shared/lists.ts`, `shared/things.ts`,
  `ThingForm.tsx`, `Grow.tsx`, `HouseholdLists.tsx`, `state.tsx`, `api.ts` and `scripts/arch.ts` are
  untouched. No ceilings moved.

---

## 2026-10-03 — Two seams opened before Recipes (reorganizer)

- **Trigger:** placement-advisor, preparing for Recipes: the Claude plumbing in
  `photo-reader.ts` and the auto-growing `Grow` textarea in `ThingForm.tsx` are each needed by a
  second owner, so each moves out first, in its own behaviour-preserving commit (two-commit rule).
- **Seam 1 (NEW owner row):** the shared Anthropic call (CLAUDE_MODEL, the lazy SDK + zod
  imports, the client with an injectable `fetch`, `beta.messages.parse` with the refusal fallback
  beta, the refusal / cut off / unexpected shape / API error → honest-failure mapping) moved from
  `src/worker/photo-reader.ts` to `src/worker/claude.ts` (`askClaude`). `claude.ts` is now the
  only importer of `@anthropic-ai/sdk` and zod, still only lazily; photo-reader keeps `readPhoto`'s
  signature, its prompt, schema and image block. Its row is narrowed to match.
- **Seam 2 (NEW owner row):** `Grow` moved from `frontend/src/components/ThingForm.tsx` to
  `frontend/src/components/Grow.tsx`, exported unchanged; ThingForm imports it.
- **Behaviour:** preserved — the photo-reader tests in `test/things-api.test.ts` pass unchanged
  (same request body, headers, refusal and API-error results). No ceilings moved: neither file is
  pinned. Recipes itself is not built here.

---

## 2026-10-03 — Sun-timed alerts: the goat alert (placement-advisor)

- **Ask:** MojoSOGO decided a daily alert 30 minutes before local sunset, "Put the goats away —
  sunset at 6:42": each person opts in (off by default), Phone + House, never on the calendar,
  findable only in Optional calendar items; sunset computed locally (NOAA) from the household
  place, ZIP 92056 (33.20 / −117.29).
- **Verdict:** one NEW owner, `src/shared/sun.ts` (pure; `Place`, `sunsetUtc`; imports only
  `time.ts`, never the engine). Everything else is a small edit to existing owners: migration
  0016 (`settings.latitude` / `longitude`, `events.start_sun`), `SUN_EVENT` in `vocab.ts`,
  `planReminderFires(…, place)` and `alertMessage(…, sunsetAt)` in `engine.ts`, the settings read
  and the reminder branch of `sourceOf` in `tick.ts`, `start_sun IS NULL` beside each
  `is_alarm = 0` in `routes/events.ts`, `startSun` on `/fires`, and the Ringing bar label.
- **Why an optional event + `start_sun`, not an opt-in alarm or a hidden flag:** optional events
  already carry everything the goat alert needs — the per-person opt-in, the audience rule (push
  to who has it on, House only when that audience is not empty), Optional calendar items, Done /
  Snooze / renotify / missed. Alarms are never optional and have no opt-in; a hidden flag would
  be a second "not on the calendar" mechanism. A start that IS the sunset is the one new fact, so
  it is one column whose vocabulary lives in `vocab.ts`. `optins.ts`, `routes/optins.ts` and the
  Settings screen are untouched.
- **No all-day fallback:** with no place or no sunset that day (polar) the occurrence is skipped
  — never planned at 09:00. At alert time a sunset that cannot be computed reads "{title} —
  before sunset", visibly not a time.
- **Ringing bar:** a sun reminder's row shows ` · sunset` where an all-day one shows ` · all day`
  (`/fires` carries `startSun`).
- **Production insert:** the coordinator creates the goat event by SQL, never a migration or a
  seed; the statement is in SPEC §14 and must run from a UTF-8 file so the 🐐 survives.

---

## 2026-10-03 — Rolling timer active time range (placement-advisor)

- **Ask:** MojoSOGO decided that a rolling timer may have an optional "Active from HH:MM to
  HH:MM" (household tz): it never rings outside it, its countdown restarts when the window opens
  (60 min on 08:00–21:00 first rings at 09:00), a fire ringing at the close goes quiet and
  resumes after the opening, and no window keeps today's behavior.
- **Verdict:** no new owner. The rule lives in the EXISTING `src/shared/engine.ts` — `TimerWindow`,
  `timerWindow`, `timerWindowError`, `inside`, `nextTimerDue`, `AlertConfig.window`, and a trailing
  optional `window` on `applyTimerCmd`; ack and start both use `nextTimerDue`. The engine stays
  pure and uses only `localToUtc` / `utcToLocal` / `addDays` from `time.ts` (§4.1 DST rules).
- **One guard:** `stepFire` gets a new first rule for timers with a window, so every path that
  could ring — first ring, renotify, a stale fire after an outage, a window edited under a
  planned fire — is stopped in one place. The route does not re-plan the open fire on PATCH.
- **The snooze shape, not a close reason:** the same fire goes back to `scheduled`, due at the
  next opening + interval, `alert_count` 0. No new CLOSE_REASON, no vocab change, no fires
  rebuild, no new fire row.
- **One `householdTz`:** exported from `src/worker/db.ts` for the timer routes; the private copies
  in `routes/alarms.ts`, `routes/chores.ts` and `routes/thing-photos.ts` are left alone (folding
  them in is a separate tidy). `tick.ts` changes only `sourceOf`'s timer branch, reading the tz in
  the same SELECT. Migration 0015 adds two nullable columns with no CHECK; the route validates.

---

## 2026-10-03 — M4l The laundry loop (placement-advisor)

- **Ask:** MojoSOGO decided the laundry loop (the dishwasher deferred): Washer and Dryer on the
  Alarms tab, each free / running / done-waiting; start = whose load + a 30/45/60/90 chip; at
  done-at remind the owner by Phone + House every 15 min up to 4 times; Move to dryer; Fold & out;
  Clear. The weekly Laundry chore (§7B) stays as it is.
- **Verdict:** three NEW owners — `src/shared/machines.ts` (rules and message text, pure, takes
  `now`; imports engine + vocab + time, never the reverse), `src/worker/routes/machines.ts` (the
  `/machines` routes, one batch per transition) and `frontend/src/components/Machines.tsx` (the
  section and the chooser) — plus `migrations/0014_machines.sql` (the `machines` table and the
  `fires` rebuild with kind `machine` + `machine_id`, `uq_machine_open`). Small edits: vocab.ts
  (`machine` kind, MACHINE, MACHINE_STATE), engine.ts (newMachineFire, `machine_id: null` in
  every constructor, an explicit machine branch in alertMessage, `PUSH_ACTIONS.machine = []`,
  applyAction refuses machine fires), tick.ts (insertFire column, a `sourceOf('machine')` branch
  — sourceOf now takes `now`, for the derived "load is waiting"), routes/alerts.ts (`/fires`
  label + owner + machineId), index.ts, Alarms.tsx, RingingBar.tsx, state.tsx.
- **Why not timers:** a timer restarts on Ack and speaks "Timer: …"; a load is handed off from
  one machine to the next and occupies it — bolting handoff and occupancy onto timers would put
  a special case in every timer path. **Why not chore runs:** a run is UNIQUE per chore and date
  and follows the weekly rotation; a load is whoever's load it is, any number of times a day.
- **Reused:** the whole fire pipeline — stepFire (renotify 15 / max 4, never missed), audience
  → push rows + one house row, tick steps 3 and 4, the Ringing bar. push.ts and house.ts are
  untouched; no new ACTION, no new CLOSE_REASON, no new tick planning step (the route inserts the
  fire at start/move, the way timers do).
- **Threats it avoids:** the **fall-through "Chore:" text** (alertMessage's final else is the
  chore sentence — machine has its own explicit branch, tested); a **Ringing bar Done that 409s**
  (machine rows get Move to dryer / Fold & out instead); a **second close path** (applyAction
  refuses machine fires; only the `/machines` routes close them); **double fires on concurrent
  taps** (each machine-row write is guarded by its `started_at` as read inside the same batch as
  the fire writes — a stale guard aborts and rolls back the whole batch → 409 `conflict` — and
  `uq_machine_open` backs it in the schema).
- **Considerations:** no CHECK on `machines.id` (the route validates with isOneOf against MACHINE);
  seeds carry literal timestamps; done-waiting and "load is waiting" are derived, never stored.
  No reorganizer needed: every touched owner had room; CEILINGS untouched.

---

## 2026-10-03 — House delivery direct, the relay retired (placement-advisor)

- **Ask:** MojoSOGO retired the LAN relay. The Worker calls Home Assistant itself at
  `https://ha.sogodojo.com` — a Cloudflare Tunnel (HA's Cloudflared add-on) behind Cloudflare
  Access — with `CF-Access-Client-Id`, `CF-Access-Client-Secret` and `Authorization: Bearer <HA token>`.
- **Verdict:** NEW `src/worker/house.ts`, the sibling of `push.ts`: houseConfigOf (all seven
  settings or null → `house_not_configured`), the drain (exhausted rows fail; up to 5 queued or
  stale-claimed rows, each claimed conditionally just before speaking and spoken only if
  `meta.changes === 1`), speak (the relay's two payloads, 15 s / 25 s ⚑, `redirect: 'manual'`,
  only a 2xx is ok), classifyHouse (`Exclude<DeliveryStatus,'queued'|'claimed'>`), houseState
  (derived from deliveries, never stored; HOUSE_STATE in vocab.ts). EXISTING: tick.ts (step 4),
  routes/announce.ts (read the 201 first, then waitUntil an id-restricted drain),
  routes/household.ts (`/status` `house`), index.ts (relay route removed), env.ts, vocab.ts
  (RELAY_REPORT_STATUS out), the PWA badge/Status (never re-derived), wrangler.toml [vars],
  vitest.config.ts (HA_URL pinned to `https://ha.test`, secrets pinned empty),
  `migrations/0013_retire_relay.sql`, scripts/arch.ts (relay root and bans out; CEILINGS untouched).
  DELETED: `relay/`, `routes/relay.ts`, `test/relay-contract.test.ts`.
- **Threats it avoids:** **double speech** (a tick and an announcement draining one row — the
  conditional per-row claim); **an Access 302 read as ok** (`redirect: 'manual'` + 2xx-only);
  **missing config succeeding quietly** (`house_not_configured`, visibly failed, zero fetches,
  and a "House not set up" badge); **tests reaching the real house** (HA_URL pinned to a fake
  host with empty secrets; tests set fake secrets per call over a fetch spy that refuses every
  other host).
- **Considerations:** a classified `failed` is final (HA or the tunnel down) — retries cover only
  stale claims, as with the relay. No reorganizer needed: house.ts is new, and every touched
  owner had room.

---

## 2026-10-03 — M4k Announcements (placement-advisor)

- **Ask:** Send a house announcement now from the Alarms tab: "<sender> says: <msg>" on Echos +
  Voice PE via the relay, optional push to members.
- **Verdict:** `src/shared/announce.ts`, `src/worker/routes/announce.ts`,
  `frontend/src/components/Announce.tsx` [NEW owner rows]; `src/worker/push.ts`,
  `src/worker/index.ts`, `frontend/src/components/Alarms.tsx` [EXISTING];
  `migrations/0012_announcements.sql` (deliveries.fire_id nullable).
- **Considerations:** an announcement is a delivery with no fire (deliveries is already the relay
  queue; push already has a fire-less payload). Rejected a fire kind 'announce' (widens
  ALERT_KIND, born-closed fire with made-up close_reason) and a new table (second queue). Parity
  fix: PushPayload gains tag so fire-less pushes don't collapse into each other. No reorganizer
  needed. Follow-up for code-steward: delivery INSERT SQL now in tick.ts and routes/announce.ts.

---

## 2026-10-03 — Re-pin after M5 (coordinator)

- `Settings.tsx` ceiling 187 + 40 → **167 + 40**: M5 replaced the placeholder PhoneAlerts with
  `PhoneAlerts.tsx` (a refinement that deleted 20 lines).

---

## 2026-10-03 — M5 Web Push (placement-advisor)

- **Verdict:** NEW `src/worker/web-push.ts` (only importer of `@block65/webcrypto-web-push`;
  per-origin VAPID header cache against a passed-in `now`), NEW `frontend/src/push-client.ts`
  (SW registration + subscribe/unsubscribe, no React), NEW `PhoneAlerts.tsx` (replaces the
  placeholder in Settings). EXISTING `push.ts` (delivery + results + test send), engine.ts
  (`pushActions`), routes/household.ts (`/push/*`), main.tsx (registration call), App.tsx
  (badge text). Static, no row: `frontend/public/sw.js`, `frontend/public/_headers`.
- **Next seam:** `/push/*` → `src/worker/routes/push.ts` when another push route arrives or
  household.ts passes ~200. RingingBar should read `pushActions` (code-steward follow-up).
- **Reorganizer:** none; Settings only shrinks — coordinator re-pins it down after merge.

---

## 2026-10-03 — Re-pin after M4i (coordinator)

- `Settings.tsx` ceiling 219 + 40 → **187 + 40**: M4i deleted the holiday checkboxes and the
  school-holidays section (refinement deletes). Bless-and-raise not needed; nothing extracted.

---

## 2026-10-03 — M4i calendar tidy (placement-advisor)

- **Verdict:** NEW `src/shared/emoji.ts` (the one-emoji rule: one grapheme, Extended_Pictographic
  or Regional_Indicator, ≤ 16 bytes — not \p{Emoji}, which lets "1" through, nor
  \p{Emoji_Presentation}, which rejects 🗑️); NEW `ReminderFields.tsx` (R5, before the
  feature); EXISTING event-rows, events, optins, household (school routes deleted), auth (/me
  prefs), state.tsx, EventForm, Calendar(.module.css), DaySheet, OptionalItems (built-in rows),
  Settings (deletions only), theme.css, seed-dev.mjs; NEW migration 0010.
- **R5:** EventForm 214/235 (in the band) → reminder section verbatim into ReminderFields.tsx,
  no visible text change; merging it into AlertFields stays MojoSOGO's call (changes labels).
- **Settings:** deletions shrink it to ~187/259 — no reorganizer; the MeSettings.tsx seam is
  retired; re-pin Settings down after merge.

---

## 2026-10-03 — M4h optional events + certain weeks (placement-advisor)

- **Verdict:** NEW `src/shared/optins.ts` (the one opt-in rule: isOnFor + audience incl. House;
  tick's private `recipients()` moves here and is deleted), `src/worker/event-rows.ts` (event
  row/input/insert + all event_optins SQL; opened by R1), `src/worker/routes/optins.ts`,
  `frontend/src/components/RepeatFields.tsx` (opened by R2), `OptionalItems.tsx`. EXISTING
  recurrence.ts (setPos lists), events.ts, alerts.ts (/fires filter), tick.ts, EventForm,
  Settings (+2 lines).
- **Reorganizer R1/R2 (R4 refactor: room for M4h):** events.ts was both routes and a library
  for alarms.ts/things.ts → `event-rows.ts`, cap re-pinned down; EventForm's Repeat section →
  `RepeatFields.tsx`, cap re-pinned down.
- **Next seams named:** Settings MeSection + PhoneAlerts → `MeSettings.tsx`; EventForm's reminder
  block deduped onto AlertFields (changes visible labels — a MojoSOGO/code-steward item).

---

## 2026-10-03 — M4g Things to do (placement-advisor)

- **Verdict:** NEW `src/shared/things.ts` (rules, pure; imports engine, never the reverse),
  `src/worker/routes/things.ts` (CRUD + Plan it), `src/worker/routes/thing-photos.ts` (R2 +
  read-photo), `src/worker/photo-reader.ts` (the only importer of `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, lazily),
  `frontend/src/components/{ThingsToDo,ThingForm,ThingPlan,ThingPhoto}.tsx`,
  `frontend/src/shrink-photo.ts`. EXISTING: engine, tick (thing reminder planning), alerts
  (/fires join), events.ts (thingId + exported `insertEventStatement`, budget ≤ 210),
  EventForm (≤ 250, `<FromThing>`), index.ts (stop clobbering Cache-Control), env, api.ts,
  HouseholdLists, RingingBar. Reorganizer: none.
- **Breakages found before building:** M1-VOCAB `status` collision (things vs deliveries →
  keyed by table.column); C13 expected rows gain `thing_id`; RingingBar's exhaustive icon
  map; the /api middleware overwriting the photo's Cache-Control; D13 needs the cap checked
  before the key; vitest pins `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ''` so a local key can't reach the API.
- **Next fire kind:** opens the pre-named seam tick.ts → `src/worker/fires.ts` first
  (sourceOf now has three per-kind branches).

---

## 2026-10-03 — M4e Lists of your own (placement-advisor)

- **Rules:** `src/shared/lists.ts` (pure; imports only `./time`, `./vocab`) gains
  `LIST_NAME_MAX`, `LISTS_MAX`, `listNameClash` (keyed by `itemKey`, mirrors
  `renameClash`), `canManageList(createdBy, member)` (creator or admin via the `Role`
  type; seeded lists, `createdBy` null, admins only) and `SHOPPING_LIST_ID` — the one
  place the seeded id is named outside the migration.
- **Schema:** `migrations/0007_custom_lists.sql`, §4.2f verbatim; 0001–0006 untouched.
  `LIST`/`List` leave `vocab.ts`; M1-VOCAB reads the migrated `sqlite_master`.
- **Route:** `src/worker/routes/lists.ts` (same file) owns list CRUD and item CRUD;
  rename/delete permission only through `canManageList`; every item read/write joins
  `lists.deleted_at IS NULL`.
- **PWA:** `HouseholdLists.tsx` keeps the shell + list panel (picker replaces the
  toggle); `HouseholdListItemForm.tsx` takes "Assigned to";
  `HouseholdListOptions.tsx` [NEW owner row] holds the new-list and ⋯ options modals.
  Styles stay in `HouseholdLists.module.css` (no new module CSS).
- **Tests:** `test/lists.test.ts` L1–L19, `test/migration-0007.test.ts` [NEW] L20,
  `test/vocab.test.ts` reads the migrated schema.

---

## 2026-10-03 — R3 refactor: room in HouseholdLists for M4e (reorganizer)

- **Trigger:** M4e placement — `HouseholdLists.tsx` at 216/300 (global cap) estimated
  ~320 with M4e (list picker, create/rename/delete lists, one assignee) in place.
- **Seam moved:** `ItemForm` + the `Item` interface → `HouseholdListItemForm.tsx`
  [NEW owner row], the seam pre-named in the Phase A receipt. `HouseholdLists.tsx`
  imports both; the type moved with the form so the import runs one way (no cycle).
- **Room opened:** `HouseholdLists.tsx` 216 → 158 lines; new file 67. No `CEILINGS`
  change (neither file is pinned; both under the global cap).
- **Behavior:** preserved (typecheck, tests, build green); code moved verbatim, no
  logic, props or imports-at-runtime changed.
- **Restraint:** shell, `ListPanel`, rows and add box untouched; no feature code added.

---

## 2026-10-03 — R2 refactor: room in Settings for M4d Invites (reorganizer)

- **Trigger:** M4d placement — `Settings.tsx` pinned at 264/304 would cross its
  ceiling with the §8.9 invite experience (link + QR + share).
- **Seam moved:** the invites block of `HouseholdSection` → `Invites.tsx` [NEW owner
  row]; `useAction` → `useAction.tsx` [NEW owner row], imported by both.
- **Room opened:** `Settings.tsx` 264 → 219 lines; ceiling `264 + WORKING_BUFFER` →
  `219 + WORKING_BUFFER` (304 → 259).
- **Behavior:** preserved (typecheck, tests, build green). Accepted difference: an
  invite error renders above the invites block, not at the top of Household; invite
  actions now have their own busy flag.
- **Restraint:** Me, Days off, Members, School holidays, Status untouched; no feature
  code added.

---

## 2026-10-03 — M4c Chores (placement-advisor)

- **Ask:** place chores (§7B): pure rules, engine changes, tick planning, API, Alarms →
  Chores section + form, Lists → Today, Ringing-bar chore rows; split into a server
  slice and a UI slice with disjoint files.
- **Verdict:** NEW `src/shared/chores.ts` (whose turn, planning, advance/undo, fire
  context, input validation — pure; imports engine, never the reverse),
  `src/worker/routes/chores.ts` (CRUD, today, done/undo, in-place re-plan; exports
  `completeStep`), `frontend/src/components/{Chores,ChoreForm,ChoresToday,AlertFields}.tsx`.
  EXISTING: `engine.ts` (fire shape + `chore_run_id`, `applyAction` chore/done gate,
  chore message text in `alertMessage`), `tick.ts` (planning, `sourceOf` chore branch,
  recipients fallback), `routes/alerts.ts` (fires-action chore branch → `completeStep`;
  `/fires` chore fields), `index.ts`, `Alarms.tsx`, `App.tsx`, `HouseholdLists.tsx`,
  `RingingBar.tsx`, `state.tsx`, `test/vocab.test.ts`.
- **Reorganizer (UI only, before the UI build):** extract day chips / days text /
  channels / repeat options from `Alarms.tsx` + `Timers.tsx` into `AlertFields.tsx`;
  split `HouseholdLists.tsx` into shell + `ListPanel`; move shared tick-row CSS into
  `Lists.module.css`.
- **Spec gaps found and fixed before dispatch:** `/fires` chore fields; edit re-plans
  runs in place (deleting runs would break `fires.chore_run_id`); `advanceRun`/`undoRun`
  take the open fire; push `done` action for chores.
- **Caps:** nothing near a cap; largest projected `HouseholdLists.tsx` ~215/300.
  Pre-named seams: `tick.ts` → `src/worker/fires.ts`; `chores.ts` → `chore-input.ts`;
  `routes/chores.ts` → `chore-runs.ts`.

---

## 2026-10-03 — Phase A Lists (placement-advisor)

- **Ask:** place household lists (shopping, wish list): item rules, routes, screen, styling.
- **Verdict:** `src/shared/lists.ts` [NEW] (normalization, add/reopen decision, limits,
  30-day window — pure); `src/worker/routes/lists.ts` [NEW] (CRUD; no match logic);
  `frontend/src/components/HouseholdLists.tsx` [NEW] (tab, toggle, rows, item modal);
  `Lists.module.css` reused unchanged — screen-only styles in
  `HouseholdLists.module.css`. Small edits to existing owners: `vocab.ts` (`LIST`),
  `worker/index.ts` (mount), `App.tsx` (tab), `test/vocab.test.ts` (EXPECTED).
- **Why:** add-or-reopen is a decision → rules stage. The screen is not named
  `Lists.tsx` because the existing shared `Lists.module.css` would read as its own.
  Matching is in JS with one normalizer, never SQLite `lower()`/`NOCASE` (ASCII-only).
- **Caps:** no pinned file touched; App.tsx 101/300. If `HouseholdLists.tsx` reaches the
  band, the seam is the item modal → `HouseholdListItemForm.tsx`.
- **Reorganizer:** none needed.

---

## 2026-10-03 — Adopt the architecture guard (bootstrap)

- **Decision:** created the ownership map with one row per existing file (no code
  moved), the `scripts/arch.ts` caps module, and `test/architecture.test.ts`.
- **Placed by:** the coordinating session. There was no map for placement-advisor to
  read yet, so the bootstrap describes what already exists instead of placing
  anything new.
- **Caps:** `GLOBAL_FILE_CAP` 300, `WORKING_BUFFER` 40. Pinned at size + buffer:
  `Settings.tsx` 264, `Calendar.tsx` 262, `EventForm.tsx` 243, `routes/events.ts`
  201. Day one: green, nothing in the warning band (highest 87 %).
- **New owners:** `scripts/arch.ts`, `scripts/arch-types.ts`, `scripts/arch-audit.ts`
  (Tooling).
