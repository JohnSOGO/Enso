# Placement receipts

One entry per full-path placement decision (new owner row, extract, or
bless-and-raise), newest first. Light-path placements go in the commit message only.
The receipt records the decision; `docs/module-ownership.md` and `scripts/arch.ts`
carry its result.

## 2026-10-03 — Adopt the architecture guard (bootstrap)

- **Decision:** created the ownership map with one row per existing file (no code
  moved), the `scripts/arch.ts` caps module, and `test/architecture.test.ts`.
- **Placed by:** the coordinating session. There was no map for placement-advisor to
  read yet, so the bootstrap describes what already exists instead of placing
  anything new.
- **Caps:** `GLOBAL_FILE_CAP` 300, `WORKING_BUFFER` 40. Pinned at size + buffer:
  `Settings.tsx` 264, `Calendar.tsx` 262, `EventForm.tsx` 243, `routes/events.ts`
  201. Day one: green, nothing in the warning band (highest 87 %).
- **New owners:** `scripts/arch.ts`, `scripts/arch-types.ts`, `scripts/arch-audit.ts`
  (Tooling).
