# Placement receipts

One entry per full-path placement decision (new owner row, extract, or
bless-and-raise), newest first. Light-path placements go in the commit message only.
The receipt records the decision; `docs/module-ownership.md` and `scripts/arch.ts`
carry its result.

## 2026-10-03 — Phase A Lists (placement-advisor)

- **Ask:** place household lists (shopping, wish list): item rules, routes, screen, styling.
- **Verdict:** `src/shared/lists.ts` [NEW] (normalization, add/reopen decision, limits,
  30-day window — pure); `src/worker/routes/lists.ts` [NEW] (CRUD; no match logic);
  `frontend/src/components/HouseholdLists.tsx` [NEW] (tab, toggle, rows, item modal);
  `Lists.module.css` reused unchanged — screen-only styles in
  `HouseholdLists.module.css`. Small edits to existing owners: `vocab.ts` (`LIST`),
  `worker/index.ts` (mount), `App.tsx` (tab), `test/vocab.test.ts` (EXPECTED).
- **Why:** add-or-reopen is a decision → rules stage. The screen is not named
  `Lists.tsx` because the existing shared `Lists.module.css` would read as its own.
  Matching is in JS with one normalizer, never SQLite `lower()`/`NOCASE` (ASCII-only).
- **Caps:** no pinned file touched; App.tsx 101/300. If `HouseholdLists.tsx` reaches the
  band, the seam is the item modal → `HouseholdListItemForm.tsx`.
- **Reorganizer:** none needed.

## 2026-10-03 — Adopt the architecture guard (bootstrap)

- **Decision:** created the ownership map with one row per existing file (no code
  moved), the `scripts/arch.ts` caps module, and `test/architecture.test.ts`.
- **Placed by:** the coordinating session. There was no map for placement-advisor to
  read yet, so the bootstrap describes what already exists instead of placing
  anything new.
- **Caps:** `GLOBAL_FILE_CAP` 300, `WORKING_BUFFER` 40. Pinned at size + buffer:
  `Settings.tsx` 264, `Calendar.tsx` 262, `EventForm.tsx` 243, `routes/events.ts`
  201. Day one: green, nothing in the warning band (highest 87 %).
- **New owners:** `scripts/arch.ts`, `scripts/arch-types.ts`, `scripts/arch-audit.ts`
  (Tooling).
